# Getting Started with SMTP

Learn how to use SwiftMail's SMTP functionality to send emails.

## Overview

The `SMTPServer` class provides a Swift-native interface for sending emails via SMTP servers. This guide will walk you through the basic steps of connecting to an SMTP server and sending emails.

## Creating an SMTP Server Instance

First, create an instance of `SMTPServer` with your server details:

```swift
import SwiftMail

let smtpServer = SMTPServer(host: "smtp.example.com", port: 587)
```

Common SMTP ports:
- 587: STARTTLS (recommended)
- 465: SSL/TLS
- 25: Unencrypted (not recommended)

## Connecting and Authentication

Connect to the server and authenticate with your credentials:

```swift
try await smtpServer.connect()
try await smtpServer.login(username: "user@example.com", password: "password")
```

## Creating and Sending Emails

Create an email message and send it:

```swift
// Create a new email
let message = Email()
message.from = "sender@example.com"
message.to = ["recipient@example.com"]
message.subject = "Hello from SwiftMail"
message.text = "This is a test email sent using SwiftMail."

// Send the email
try await smtpServer.send(message)
```

## Adding Attachments

You can add attachments to your emails:

```swift
let attachment = Attachment(
    filename: "document.pdf",
    mimeType: "application/pdf",
    data: fileData
)
message.attachments.append(attachment)
```

## Error Handling

SwiftMail uses Swift's error handling system. Common errors include:
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication failures
- Invalid email addresses
- Server timeouts
- Attachment size limits

Always wrap SMTP operations in try-catch blocks:

```swift
do {
    try await smtpServer.connect()
    try await smtpServer.login(username: "user@example.com", password: "password")
    try await smtpServer.send(message)
} catch {
    print("SMTP error: \(error)")
}
```
